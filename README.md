Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Flask
Database: SQLAlchemy (with Flask-Migrate for migrations)
Authentication: Flask-Login, Flask-Bcrypt
Admin Interface: Flask-Admin
API Management: Flask-Cors, RESTful Blueprints
Rich Text Editing: Flask-CKEditor
Email Handling: Flask-Mail
Frontend: Jinja2 Templates
Other Libraries:
Alembic, bcrypt, flask-wtf, WTForms, Pillow, Mako, Flask-Modals, and more.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/TarekzainAldin/FranTrek-Code.git
cd FranTrek-Code
Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

ini
Copy code
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///site.db
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.yourmailserver.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
Replace your_secret_key, your_email, and your_email_password with actual values.

Database Migration
After setting up the environment, run the following commands to initialize the database:

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
Run the Application
Finally, to run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to see the application in action.
